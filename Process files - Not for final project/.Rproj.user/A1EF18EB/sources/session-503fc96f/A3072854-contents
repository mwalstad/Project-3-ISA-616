## Package Installation and Initialization

In this portion we use `pacman` to install the necessary packages and clear the global environment.

```{r setup,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, out.width = "100%")
#package initialization
rm(list = ls()) # clear global environment
graphics.off() # close all graphics
if(require(pacman)==FALSE) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(DataExplorer, # For explorer and cleaning data by visualizing missing values.
               httr, # For downloading the data from the UCI
               tidyverse, # For data manipulation
               corrplot, # for heatmaps
               DataExplorer, #for exploring data
               skimr, # for nice summary of data
               readxl #to read Excel files
               ) # For creating dummy variables of categorical variables automatically.)
```

## Load data

### Loading BA Students

This is the list of students under consideration.  Here is the logic for this data pull:

* Cohort Academic Year Number is equal to 2020 , 2021 , 2022 , 2023 , 2024				
* Cohort Semester Name is equal to / is in Fall				
  * Case When Majors and Concentrations."Major"= 'Business Analytics' And Concentrations and Thematic Sequences."Concentration" = 'Basic Program (no submajor)' Then 'BA Major' When Majors and Concentrations."Major" = 'Analytics' And Concentrations and Thematic... is equal to / is in BA Major or Minor is equal to / is in Business Analytics

```{r}
BA_Students=read_excel("data-raw/BA Major Students.xlsx")
head(BA_Students)
paste("The number of rows in the data is ",nrow(BA_Students))
paste("The number of unique students is ",length(unique(BA_Students$`Student ID`)))
write.csv(BA_Students,"data-clean/BA_Students.csv")

```


### Loading BA Majors

Below I read in the data and fill in the missing values with the correct values.  The level of analysis is Student ID X Term Code.  Each student has a row for each term they have been enrolled.  Some students have one row, others have eight.

Finally, I make sure that each student has the Cohort Term that is equal to the earliest date on record.

```{r}
# Read data
BA_Majors=read_excel("data-raw/BA Major Students - Majors.xlsx")
# Fill in the blank cells created from the format of the data
BA_Majors=BA_Majors %>% 
  fill(c(`Student ID`:`Term Code`),.direction="down")
#Create a separate column for each major.  Unit of analysis here is student by Term Code
BA_Majors=BA_Majors %>% 
  group_by(`Student ID`,`Term Code`) %>% 
  mutate(Major_Number=paste("Major",row_number())) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=Major_Number, values_from=`BA Major`) 

# Set the Cohort Term to the smallest observed value for a given student. 
BA_Majors=BA_Majors %>% 
  group_by(`Student ID`) %>% 
  mutate(`Cohort Term`=min(`Cohort Term`)) 

head(BA_Majors)
paste("The number of rows is ",nrow(BA_Majors))
paste("The number of unique students is ",length(unique((BA_Majors$`Student ID`))))

write.csv(BA_Majors,"data-clean/BA_Majors.csv")
```

### Loading Grades

Loaded student grades, filled in missing cells according to the data structure.  There are only 694 students.  This is possibly because the freshmen do not yet have grades. I checked this, and there are 140 freshmen who have no grades.  694+140=834.  We have 823 unique students in the file.  It is possible that 834+823=11 students in cohort 202410 have grades, possibly due to dual enrollment or summer classes prior to the Fall semester.

```{r}
# Read data
Grades=read_excel("data-raw/BA Major Students - Grades.xlsx")
# Fill in the blank cells created from the format of the data
Grades = Grades %>% 
  fill(c(`Student ID`),.direction="down")

head(Grades)
tail(Grades)
paste("The number of unique students is ",length(unique(Grades$`Student ID`)))
num_fresh=BA_Majors %>%
  filter(`Cohort Term`=="202410")%>%
  nrow()
paste("The number of students starting in term 201410 is ", num_fresh)

write.csv(Grades,"data-clean/Grades.csv")
```

### Loading Attributes

Below I load in the Attributes.  There are 134 students with missing cumulative GPA.  

The level of analysis for the final data frame is Student ID X Term Code.

```{r}
# Read data
Attributes=read_excel("data-raw/BA Major Students - Attributes and CUM GPA.xlsx")
# Fill in the blank cells created from the format of the data
Attributes = Attributes %>% 
  fill(c(`Student ID`:`First Generation Indicator`),.direction="down")

paste("The number of unique students is ",length(unique(Attributes$`Student ID`)))

head(Attributes)
test=Attributes %>% 
  filter(is.na(`Cum UG Crs GPA`))

paste("The number of students with no grades ",length(unique(test$`Student ID`)))
write.csv(Attributes,"data-clean/Attributes.csv")
```
