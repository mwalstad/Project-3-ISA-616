## Introduction

This document is meant to summarize where we currently are (group 8) in the beginning off our analysis project for ISA 616.

## Client
Skip Benamati and the Business Analytics/ISA Dept.

## Problem Statement
It is challenging to predict demand for the program and course size for the Business Analytics program. Skip and the BA department would like to know the forecasted number of students so that courses are not offered over abundantly or insufficiently.

## Research Questions we Want to Answer
* How many students are forecasted to be in the Spring 2024 BA cohort? 
* Historically, what characteristics define students who stay with the BA major?
* Historically, what characteristics define students who donâ€™t stay with the BA major?
* What majors are people transferring to BA from?
* What courses have a significant impact on whether students stay with the BA major?

## Our Final Deliverables
* An RMarkdown document containing background information on our project scope, BVP, and questions to answer.
* A document containing our EDA analysis that guides viewers through the steps we took to clean our data.
* A dashboard containing visuals, graphs, and tables that visualize our findings per our research questions.
* A document containing our conclusions, final insights, and further recommendations to Skip and the BA department.
