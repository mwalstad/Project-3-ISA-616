## Introduction

This document is meant to summarize where we currently are (group 8) in the beginning off our analysis project for ISA 616.

## Client

Skip Benamati, Alan Strautman, and the Business Analytics/ISA Dept.

## Problem Statement

It is challenging to predict demand for the program and course size for the Business Analytics program.
Skip and the BA department would like to know the forecasted number of students so that courses are not offered over abundantly or insufficiently.

## Research Questions we Want to Answer

-   How many students are forecasted to be in the Spring 2024 BA cohort?
-   Is there a relationship between any student characteristics and students who stay with the BA major?
-   Is there a relationship between any student characteristics and students who leave the BA major?
-   Are there any majors at Miami University that have a relationship with students joining or leaving the BA program?
-   Do certain courses moderate the relationship between students joining and leaving the BA program?

## Our Final Deliverables

-   An RMarkdown document containing background information on our project scope, BVP, and questions to answer.
-   A document containing our EDA analysis that guides viewers through the steps we took to clean our data.
-   A dashboard containing visuals, graphs, and tables that visualize our findings per our research questions.
-   A document containing our conclusions, final insights, and further recommendations to Skip and the BA department.

## Our Business Value Proposition

![](BVP_group8.png)

Client: 

-   Skip Benamati Professor and chair of the Information Systems & Analytics along with his staff including Alan Clift (Data and planning Analyst)

Jobs:

-   Accurately predict demand for classes

-   Understand the flow of students in and out of Business Analytics major

Pains:

-   Before:

    -   Abundance of BA majors who end up dropping  

-   During: 

    -   Student retention -- understanding characteristics of students who stay and do not stay with the BA major

    -   Understanding what students are switching to the BA major

    -   If BA courses have an impact on whether students stay in business analytics

-   After:

    -   Over offering classes (results in too many small sized classes)

Solution:

-   Dashboard with insights about Business Analytics students using graphs and other visuals

Pain Killers:

-   Identify key characteristics of students who leave the major 

-   Identify classes that may need curriculum change in order to retain my students

-   Understand why students switch to the BA major and what majors they come from 

Gains:

-   Confidence promoting program

-   Pipeline of students from advising 

-   Use for other majors (ISA)

Gain Creators:

-   Advice tailored to the results on how to better market the BA program

-   Resources for advising that help identify prospective BA students
